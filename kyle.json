	"elevator_speach": "I can't remember a time without my own computer. You could say I was a bit of a nerd growing up. I spent my childhood taking things apart just to put them back together again. Building has always been a part of my inquisitive nature, and now I enjoy it for a living as a web designer and front-end developer. The intricacy of writing code has always fascinated me. My natural love for trouble-shooting and well trained eye for design allow me to offer a more versatile skill set. This combination aligned with my passion for what I do puts me a cut above the rest.",
